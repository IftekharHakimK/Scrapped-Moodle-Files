Step 1:
-------
The given problem is NP. Because we can verify its solution in polynomial time.
Given a solution of size at least K. We can test whether it is correct by checking if all of
its vertices are distinct and adjacent, and size of the list at least K.
It can be checked in O(number of vertices) time or in O(n) time.

Step 2:
-------
Problem of hamiltonian path problem can be reduced to the given problem. Because solving 
the hamiltonian path problem can be done by solving the given problem for K=n-1.

Step 3:
-------
Reduction of hamiltonian path problem to the given problem is in polynomial time.
Because solution to the given problem with K=n-1 can be easily reduced. This solution has n-1
edges. This path is exactly a hamiltonian path. There is nothing to reduce anymore.

Step 4:
-------
If the given problem has solution with K=n-1, there must be one hamiltonian path.
If there is a hamiltonian path, the given problem will find has a solution with K=n-1.

So, in short, if there is no hamiltonian path, the given problem will not have a solution with K=n-1.
Similarly, if the given problem has no solution with K=n-1, there is no hamiltonian path.

Hence, the given problem is NP-complete.
