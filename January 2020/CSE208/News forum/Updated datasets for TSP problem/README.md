Dear students,Hope you are doing well. I am attaching an updated dataset for your <a href="..%5C..%5Cfile%5CCSE208-Jan-2020_%20Branch%20and%20Bound.pdf">Offline on Branch and Bound</a> technique.Those who have already performed experimentation with the previous dataset, they can keep the result. But the graphs provided in the new dataset is much smaller. So you can generate result using these graphs in a short time. So you must show us the results of this new data set. The graphs in the SMALL folder are in an adjacency matrix format.The description is also slightly updated.You can post your queries (if you have any) under this thread or call me.<br />Thanks,Mushfiq
