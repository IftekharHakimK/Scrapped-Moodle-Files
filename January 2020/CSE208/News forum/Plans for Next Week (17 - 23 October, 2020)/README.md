Â 

Dear Students,The next week (17 - 23 October) will be used as a reserved week and your offline on red-black tree will be evaluated in the 31 October - 7 November week, after the vacation.So, <b>students of A2 and B1, your regular CSE 208 sessional classes will not be held next week</b>.<b>Students of A1 and B2, your pending offline(s) will be evaluated in the next week</b><b>. Since multiple offline evaluations may be pending, you may have to come at multiple timeslots (if the respective teacher asks), or may have to be present for an extended duration beyond the regular class time.</b>Some students could not perhaps attend one or more regular classes in the last few weeks, for sickness or some other unavoidable reasons. In that case, please communicate with your respective subsection teachers if possible. If it is convenient for you now, hopefully your tasks will be evaluated in the reserved week (next week).If you have any query, please post under this thread. Thank you.
