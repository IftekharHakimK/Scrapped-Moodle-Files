Dear Students,The marks you have obtained upto the 4th offline, practice/viva/online are published <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M3TZEA8Ff8NVcWeuMViSDZYBEJhSWWP_rM-Q2aPLe7Y/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. The link is also shared at the top section of the course page. Please check your marks and let us know if you think there is any discrepancy.<ul><li>Unfortunately, we have found some potential plagiarism attempts from our rigorous copy checking process. Those who have got the "Potential Copy" comment, will get a chance to defend and convince us otherwise. But if you have indeed copied, please do not come up with futile arguments, as that may not help much. A copy check defense will be held on next Thursday - November 19, 2020 at 11 am. The link will be shared later.</li></ul><ul><li>Besides we did not find some submissions, neither from Moodle, nor via email. Those who have got the "No Submission" comment, if you submitted your offline to a course teacher via email, please forward it to me (you can find my email address in the course outline) by next Tuesday (November 17, 2020).</li></ul><ul><li>We also received a lot of improper submissions, like zipping the source files directly without putting them in a folder with your student no. as its name, or compressing them in .rar format and so on. We have not mentioned those in the comments. But please be careful about this and follow the submission instructions properly.</li></ul>Note that, some marks (the ones with comments) may be updated.<br />If you have any comments, please post under this thread. Thank you.<br />
