Please check your submission status of QUIZ1 after midterm. You were supposed to click the submission button and accept the submission as per QUIZ1 settings. Those who did not do it, their submission is not submitted. For them, tomorrow Monday at 10am-11am (Office hour of CSE215), I shall be present in ZOOM meeting. You must be present in Zoom. I shall open submission for them individually. You must submit the same file that was submitted and shown as draft. <br />
