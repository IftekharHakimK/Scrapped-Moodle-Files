<b>Attention: A2 and B1</b>
<b><br /></b>
There will be a makeup class for both A2 and B1 on the upcoming Saturday (17th October).

Topic: <b>Practice class </b>on SQL and Advanced SQL<b>, </b><b>No evaluation</b>

On the next Wednesday (21st October), it will be a bit hectic for you. You need to <b>submit the DDL</b> for the complete database setup of your project, and there will be an <b>online</b> on <b>SQL (both basic and advanced)</b>.

A submission link for DDL will be open shortly. You can submit the DDL anytime before Wednesday's sessional slot.

We understand that it is a little inconvenience for you, but we don't have many good options at hand. I would suggest practicing SQL during the weekend.
