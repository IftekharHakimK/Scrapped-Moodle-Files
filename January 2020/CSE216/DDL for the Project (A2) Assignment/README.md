<h2>DDL for the Project (A2)</h2>File name should be "studentID1_studentID2_..._studentIDN.txt". If multiple students are working on a project, only one of them needs to submit.<b>Please do not submit multiple instances of the same project.</b>For example, If 1705020 and 1705028 are working on a project, the name of the file should be <b>1705020_1705028.txt, </b>either 1705020 or 1705028 needs to submit. If 1705076 is working alone on a project, the name should be <b>1705076.txt</b><b><br /></b><br />Put all the create/alter table queries (with constraints) inside the text file. The tables should be created resolving all dependencies. For example, if there is a <b>course_enrollment </b>table in your database, which uses the primary key of <b>student</b> and <b>course </b>table, then <b>student</b> and <b>course</b> should be created before <b>course_enrollment</b>. Separate each DDL query by one or more newlines.
