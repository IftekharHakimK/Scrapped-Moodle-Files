Dear all,We ran a copy checker among all of your submissions (in the last offline) and found the following students guilty for copying. It really does not matter who is the source and who is the destination. All of you will (probably) get -100% mark in this offline. That's the usual practice in our department. We are publishing the results in pair (students who have same/similar code). Please note that we are not publishing the outputs of our software blindly. We have checked and compared each pair's code side by side thoroughly and reached this conclusion. We completely ignored the generic codes. For example, many of you used my code which is absolutely fine. We performed the checking among the codes you had to write.If you feel that you didn't copy from your pair or from the internet, you will have a chance to defend yourself on Saturday at 12:00 PM at Database Lab. If you did copy, no need to come and apologize. We are deeply shocked after seeing this result and believe that this heinous act must be punished.<b>Result</b><b></b><table><colgroup><col></col><col></col><col></col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>1705003</td><td>1705049</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1705053</td><td>1705088</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1705057</td><td>1705058</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1705087</td><td>1705089</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1705120</td><td>1705122</td><td>1705059</td></tr><tr><td>1705020</td><td>1705047</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1705091</td><td>1705066</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1705013</td><td>1705034</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
