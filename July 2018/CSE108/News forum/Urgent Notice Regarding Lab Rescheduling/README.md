Dear All,Due to unavoidable circumstances, it is not possible to take A2, B1's lab this Tuesday. This lab will be held on next Saturday (January 19) at regular class time. We will evaluate JavaFX offline and conduct this week's online on that day.As for next week, I shall take a demo class on Networking. The sessional class schedule is according to the following:A1, B2 - in room 103 at 11:00 AM on Sunday (January 20)A2, B1 - in room 103 at 2:30 PM on Tuesday (January 22)<br />Please keep in mind that the offline will be published on Sunday (Jan 20)  and the submission deadline will be on Saturday at 02:00 AM (Jan 26).
