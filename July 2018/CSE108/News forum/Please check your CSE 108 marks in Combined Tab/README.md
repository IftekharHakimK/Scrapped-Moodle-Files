Dear All,Please ignore the previous message. Now, check all of your CSE 108 marks here:<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O1weRf3BHDe1rWkE4bDZOJ4YZuFhNUt8c_1vfyFY7Vk/edit#gid=1183731244">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O1weRf3BHDe1rWkE4bDZOJ4YZuFhNUt8c_1vfyFY7Vk/edit#gid=1183731244</a><br />You MUST check the marks of the "Combined" tab. Since I had to merge all of your marks and convert some of them to a common scale, it is very much possible that I might have made mistakes. Every offline mark has been converted to 20 and online mark has been converted to 10.I request ALL of you to take a good look at your marks. Let me know about any discrepancy by tomorrow.Thanks,<br />
