<h2>Out of the text assignment #3</h2>10 prisoners were told that they would be given an opportunity if being free. Next day in the morning they will be arranged as per desire of the jailor  in a line  so that anybody can see heads of all people in the front. Then they would be given a cap on each one's head from  large collection of white and black hats. Then the person standing last in the line would be asked the colour of the heat he was wearing. If the answer was correct he would be set free. Then the next person would be asked the same question, and finally the person in the front of the line. Prisoners after reaching cell devised a way in which more than half of the prisoners would be set free. What is the strategy? What about if there were  prisoners and each of them was given hat of any of the known m colours?
