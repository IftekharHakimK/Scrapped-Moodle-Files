Dear All,Please find a txt file in the <a href="..%5C..%5CSlides%20Folder">slides</a> section with pointers to different sections of Rosen for the materials I tried to cover. Please note the following:The materials in the <a href="..%5C..%5CSlides%20Folder">slides</a> may cover more concepts than covered in the Rosen sections. In that case, read from the <a href="..%5C..%5CSlides%20Folder">slides</a> directly. Reading the concepts covered in the <a href="..%5C..%5CSlides%20Folder">slides</a> will be enough. Based on these concepts you should practice solving more problems from Rosen as well as from various other sources.<br />ThanksSohel<br /><br /><br />
