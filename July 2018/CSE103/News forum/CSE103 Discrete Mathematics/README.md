CSE103 Discrete Mathematics
by <a href="https://moodle.cse.buet.ac.bd/user/view.php?id=20&course=382">Dr. M. Kaykobad</a> - Wednesday, 31 October 2018, 8:53 AM


 

Welcome to the course CSE103 on Discrete Mathematics. This is one of the core courses of CSE discipline. This will give you foundation for analytical skill and logical development required to play any role in advancing computer science, especially in areas of theoretical computer science, design and analysis of algorithms, theory of computational complexity. I expect you to create a stimulating environment for learning and brainstorming over problems and concepts of discrete mathematics through moodle.<br />The syllabus for Discrete Mathematics reads: <br />
<br />
Set theory; Relations; Functions; Graph theory; Propositional calculus and predicate calculus; Mathematical reasoning: induction, contradiction and recursion; counting; Principles of inclusion and exclusion; Recurrence relations; Algebraic structures: rings and groups. 
<br />
<br />
The course will be taught by Professor Md Sohel Rahman and myself, and we shall be conducting 2 class tests each. ±We shall be following the book "Discrete mathematics and Its Applications 7th edition by Kenneth Rosen. The book contains a good number of exercises after each section. Every student will have to solve the exercises and submit not later than 7 days of the assignment. However, if somebody fails to solve them in time I shall be generously accepting solutions afterwards although not as generously they may be graded. In addition I shall be assigning some problems in the class room or through moodle for which solutions coming first will carry credits. Any assignment will be submitted through moodle to me, and to a student who will be verifying the solution. Incentives/credits are there for both solving the assignments and for verifying the solutions. A student should be solving all assignments from each section  for which exercise_no mod max_exercise=(11*C+9*S+rightmost3digitsofsolvingstudentno) mod max_exercisewhere C stands for chapter no., S stands for section no.,  max_exercise is the maximum number of exercises in the chapter and section in question. The exercise will be verified by rightmost3digitsofverifyingstudentno=(11*C+9*S+rightmost3digitsofsolvingstudentno) mod 60 +1 pm 60For section A pm is plus and for section B pm is -.Assignments/problems set from outside will be numbered consecutively with chapter no. =0 and section no. =0.All mod values are positive.
