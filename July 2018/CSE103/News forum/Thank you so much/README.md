Dear CSE103 students,I was simply overwhelmed by all that you have done today. This has never happened to me that current students have kept something for remembrance. Our alumni have done it many times. Thank you very much for all your kind feelings for me. I can never think that I shall retire. I shall always be doing things I like most, and I always get happiness  once I can do things I like. I am also afraid that this watch must be a very costly item, and you have spent significant amount of money for it. One of my friends had to use a costly stent for his heart blockage, and he told me he would have to have an insurance policy to protect it from grabbers. Stents cannot be seen from outside watches can be. <br />In spite of the fact that we believe our education system is not doing well but fact remains  you belong to a different class, one in 10,000 and you should not underact. You have immense potential, and this has to be exploited in full. Young IOI students often beat all university teams, and there is exceedingly low probability that they will get into BUET. Please read about Yitang Zhang I told you in the class, and see the determination he cherished in his mind in spite of all the odds of life he was surrounded with. Not everyone of you will be doing programming contest. There are many branches of activities, and there must be one or two who will be flying CSE BUET flags and that of Bangladesh in each branch.<br />Your seniors have created heritage, they inherited nothing. It is your turn to develop it further,  cement it, strengthen it.I have all the best wishes for each of you. I am sure you will go the distance in your life, earn name and fame for yourself, for the department, for the university and for our country and finally for the society and the distressed people who are facilitating your education.<br />Thank you very much for expressing your feelings for me. I remain thankful and  grateful to all my students for what they have shaped me into.Mohammad Kaykobad<br />
