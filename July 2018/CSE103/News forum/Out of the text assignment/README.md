4. An old father told his son that he stored some gold in a forest. The son must find two identical trees A and B, and a stone S. He hen should walk from AS to A and equal distance perpendicularly towards the other tree to  find a point C. He should again come back to the stone S and do the same with respect to the other tree B to obtain a point D. Gold is just in the middle of the line joining C and D. The son could find trees but not the stone. How could he find the gold?
