Dear students of A1,As discussed we will take online on pointer, 2D array, string on the next Wednesday. We will also evaluate your projects on that. The online will start at 11:05 AM <b>(Sharp) </b>and will continue till 11:55 AM. We shall start project evaluation after that. So come to the lab as early as possible. Also, do not forget to bring your project .exe file along with necessary dll files and images in a folder so that we can run it on the Teacher machine without compiling the source code.Thanks.
