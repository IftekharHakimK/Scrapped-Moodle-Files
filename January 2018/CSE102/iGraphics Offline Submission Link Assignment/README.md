<h2>iGraphics Offline Submission Link</h2>Create a folder by your student id, say, 1705XXX, where XXX holds the last three digits of your student id (say 1705061). Put both your offline codes in that folder and zip it. So you will have a zipped folder like 1705XXX.zip (say 1705061.zip). Upload that zipped folder in this submission window.
