1. Find the smallest and second smallest element from an array.
2. Find variance of n numbers.
3. Write a program in C to print the duplicate elements in an array exactly once.
4. Write a C program to delete all the prime numbers from an array.
5. Write an efficient C program to find the sum of contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers which has the largest sum.
6. Calculate Median of two sorted arrays of same size.
7. Write a program to print all the LEADERS in the array. An element is leader if it is greater than all the elements to its right side. And the rightmost element is always a leader. For example int the array {16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2}, leaders are 17, 5 and 2.
8. Write a C program to count the number of inversions in an array. Formally speaking, two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion if a[i] > a[j] and i < j
9. Write a C program to find the union and intersection of two sorted arrays.
10. Write a C program to find the Next Greater element in an array. Given an array, print the Next Greater Element (NGE) for every element. The Next greater Element for an element x is the first greater element on the right side of x in array. Elements for which no greater element exist, consider next greater element as -1.
