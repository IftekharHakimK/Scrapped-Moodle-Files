Dear Students,Your CT-4 marks and attendance count for my classes have been published. Please check the <a href="https://moodle.cse.buet.ac.bd/mod/url/view.php?id=10962">Continuous Evaluation (SSE)</a> sheet and let me know if you find any discrepancies.On another note, if you submit the <a href="..%5C..%5Cfile%5CCSE409_Coding_Assignment.pdf">Coding Assignment</a>, I will try to consider your best 3 performances among all the CTs/Assignments, instead of the best 2 from the last 3, as per your request.Thank you.
