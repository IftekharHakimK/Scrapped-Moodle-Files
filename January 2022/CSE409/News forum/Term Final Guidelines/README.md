Dear Students,Here is a brief guideline of how you can prepare for the CSE409 term final examination (SSE's part). More important topics, more likely types of questions, and some common instructions are mentioned below. Note that, there may be some questions of different types and/or from different topics from the ones explicitly mentioned here.<br />Hidden Surface RemovalTopics: AllQuestion Types: Simulation, Explanation etc.<br />Ray Casting and Ray TracingTopics: Ray Object Intersection, Reflection, RefractionQuestion Types: Derivation, Calculation etc.<br />IlluminationTopics: Phong Lighting Model, Phong Shading Model, Texture, ShadowQuestion Types: Conceptual, Justification etc.<br />ClippingTopics: Line Clipping, Polygon ClippingQuestion Types: Simulation, Calculation etc.<br />RasterizationTopics: Midpoint Line Algorithm, Midpoint Circle AlgorithmQuestion Types: Derivation, Calculation etc.<br />AntialiasingTopics: AllQuestion Types: Conceptual, Comparison etc.<br />FractalTopics: AllQuestion Types: Derivation, Calculation, Construction etc.<b><br /></b>* There will be very few memorization based questions.<br />* Please answer precisely. Unnecessary elaboration will not help.* If you feel some information is missing in a question, you can make suitable assumptions. Mention your assumptions clearly in the answers in that case.* You are expected to show detailed steps in the simulation questions unless stated otherwise.<br />* Some of the justification/explanation questions may be open-ended. So, try to place your arguments logically in light of the subject knowledge to support your answer.Please try to follow the class lectures to comprehend the topic-wise important concepts and read textbooks for a deeper understanding. Let me know if you have any query.Thank you.
