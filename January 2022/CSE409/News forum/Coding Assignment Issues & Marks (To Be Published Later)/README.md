1705020, 039, 060, 115 - Submitted source file only, no input/output as mentioned in the specs(Some others also did not submit all the files though you submitted zip files)1705022 - Did not submit source file1705034 - The source file is named 1705013.cpp. Why?@All who have submitted, you can test with the attached test cases (use the regular or color input as appropriate for your code). Please let me know by posting replies to this thread if you think there is any issue with the input.You will be notified when the marks will be published. But I just wanted to make sure I did not miss any functionality of your codes and so, shared the test input file. There are 7 line segments in the input file. If someone's program does not run with all of them, you can further check with the first 4 lines of the input file. If it still does not work, you can check with the first 3 and 2 lines respectively. Thus you can have an idea of what things you have handled in your implementation. Those who have processed color, I have found very few submissions where different primitives truly impact the same pixel with their respective colors.Thank you.

Sir, I was out of network and was struggling to access moodle. So I had to send it to a friend for submission. He mistakenly renamed it wrong. I apologize for this. -1705034

Sir,For the 4th and 5th lines in my case, if you simply interchange the start and end points for both, you can have both lines drawn.I assumed during implementation that 1st point inserted by the tester is always on the lefthand (up) side  w.r.to the other point (righthand down side) inserted 2nd.I am extremely sorry for the misunderstanding. N.B: I had expected such probable scenarios for the vertical and horizontal lines so I handled those only.I am adding the changed input file for your convenience.Sincerely ,1705<b>021</b>

Sir,I have made a silly typo in my code. So my program is crashing when I tested it with your given input file. I have sent you a mail regarding my issue.Sincerely,1705074

Sir,I have the same issue described by Shadmim Hasan Sifat. The x values of the endpoints of the 4th and 5th lines are in decreasing order, so if they are switched, those two lines are drawn correctly. This was a mistake in my implementation due to a wrong assumption. The working input file is attached.-1705037

Sir, to generate output for the given input file, line 5 and 6 have to be excluded. Here is the supported input file for my submission.- 1705013

Sir, <br />I
 have the same issue as Shadmim Hasan Sifat, where I assumed the input 
points will be given in increasing order of x-value. So, if the 4th and 
5th lines' points are switched, it shows all the seven lines in color otherwise it shows the other five lines. <br />The working input file is attached.-1705018<br />

Sir,As I didn't handle the 7th case in my code, it is getting stuck there due to my implementation error. Also like a few, I also considered the cases where the x co-ordinates are given in the increasing order. If the order of co-ordinates are switched, it works fine. I am attaching the input.txt with the initial 6 cases which produces output in my code.1705005

Sir,Like many others, For input 4 and 5, I also considered the cases where the x coordinates are given in increasing order. If the order of<br />the coordinates are switched, it works fine.<br />I have another issue in my code which I mailed you about. The modified input file is attached with the mail. - 1705091<br />

Assalamualaikum sir.<br />I have the same issue as described by Shadmim Hasan Sifat. I assumed the input points will be given in increasing order of x-coordinates and so my code produces 5 lines inherently. However, if the 4th and 5th lines' points are swapped in the input file, all 7 lines are displayed.<br />The working input file is attached. Thank you!-1705110
