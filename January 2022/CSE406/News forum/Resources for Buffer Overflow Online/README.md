Dear All,I have uploaded the necessary resources and the video tutorial on the course page. Please do read the readme file.On online day, please try to bring your laptops and make sure the VM environment is setup correctly on your machine. If someone wants to perform their online on lab PC, please configure your VM beforehand prior to your online. Note that our lab machines have lower RAM and running virtualbox might be difficult in them. I have added the reference book,slide, onlines of previous batch for practice, the video tutorial, necessary commands to run and a compilation of GDB commands you might need in your online.Please let me know your queries regarding the offline / buffer overflow in general as a reply to this post.-Mukit. <br /><br />
