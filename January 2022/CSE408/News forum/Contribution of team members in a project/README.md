Â 

In a team project, all members of the team are expected to contribute equally. We have heard multiple instances where one or two team members aren't contributing to the project at all. If someone doesn't contribute to a project, he/she won't get any marks. We will check the Github repository of every project and manually verify the contribution of every team member by asking questions. So make sure that all the members of your team contribute equally to the project.<br />
