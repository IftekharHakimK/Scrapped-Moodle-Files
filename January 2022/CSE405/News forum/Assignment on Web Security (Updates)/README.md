Dear All,Deadline has been extended to 24 July 8 AM. There will be no further extensions.Also, for the submission, for XSS and CSRF attacks, you can - either submit two seperate video of 15 minutes maximum length each, as in the original spec - or submit a single video of 30 minutes maximum length covering both the XSS and CSRF attack tasks.For the sql injection attack you still have to submit a maximum 15 minute video.Also note that, there is now no minimum time limit on any video. But keep in mind that lack of explanation will result in mark deduction.
