Â 

Dear Students, we would like to have a brief session with you this Wednesday (March 1, 2023) from 2.30pm at CL. The attendance is not mandatory as some of you may have other engagements at that time. But, we will be glad to have you all there. After this short meeting, we will go on with evaluating the pending submissions of Assignment-5, as per the schedule.
