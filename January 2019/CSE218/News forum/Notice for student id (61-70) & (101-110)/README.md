Due to unavoidable reasons, I can not attend any sessional on Wednesday (July 31). Hence, I have evaluated the students of my part. Roll (61-70) and (101-110) do not need to be present in their respective sessional classes on Wednesday (July 31).The following student groups' CSE 218 assignment 3 has been evaluated and the mark has been uploaded. I am pointing out the problems here:61- No x,y label & correlation coefficient is shown as squared69- No x,y label101- Wrong curve equations & correlation coefficients102- Wrong file submission104- Nothing work105- xlim & ylim not dynamic106- xlim & ylim not dynamic109- Point curve is poor (too thick)110- correlation coefficient is shown as squaredIf anyone still has any issues or concerns, feel free to email me or call me.
