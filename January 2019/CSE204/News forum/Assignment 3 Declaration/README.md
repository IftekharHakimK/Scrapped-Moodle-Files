The question does not specify the data type of the elements to be stored in the stack or the queue.<br />Should we assume the data type to be integer, or do we have to use generic programming?<br />

Sir, I had some questions. It'll be helpful if you could help. <br /><br />1. <b>Stack </b>: Let's assume, I pushed 13 items to a stack. And then popped it 4 times. First, the stack had initial capacity of 10, then it increased to 20. After it had been popped, the size has become 9. Do, we need to reshape the stack capacity to 10 again ?<br /><br />2. <b>Queue </b>: The <b>front </b>reference index of the queue should always be 0, right ?3. <b>Queue </b>: Do we need to reshape it like I said for the stack ?
