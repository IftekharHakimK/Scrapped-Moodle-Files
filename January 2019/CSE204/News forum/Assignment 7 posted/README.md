Sir,In the 1st part of the offline, we are asked to generate best, avg and worst cases prior to applying sorting on the arrays. But these cases are not similar for quicksort and mergesort algorithms. So, should we prompt the user for when he wants to generate the array, which sorting algorithm he wants to generate the case for? If so, this approach has a drawback that suppose the user said that he wants to generate best case for mergesort, but then after generating the array, he applies quicksort on it. Then that would be the worst case scenario for quicksort. What should be done then?

By best case I meant already sorted array (ascending order). And by worst case I meant reversely sorted array (descending order). Average case is of random order. Now I can realize that phrasing these cases as best/worst/average is a bit ambiguous. We should refer to these cases as ascending/descending/random. Thank you for pointing it out.
