- "Mention" and "Describe" aren't the same. When you are asked to describe, you should write some description / reason / procedure / consequence.- Be careful about wording. For example, "page" and "block" aren't the same. Similarly, "page entry" and "page table" aren't the same.- While solving a mathematical problem, only calculation without any logical explanation won't bring any mark most of the time (even if your final answer is correct). Be precise, but don't leave the logical explanation out. If your final answer is somehow correct but the calculation doesn't make any sense or is incorrect, you can't expect marks. Similarly, if your answer doesn't contain the correct answer, you can't expect marks no matter how many pages you have written. - Carefully read the book and follow the slides. Try to understand all the small details. You can also contact me if you get stuck somewhere.
