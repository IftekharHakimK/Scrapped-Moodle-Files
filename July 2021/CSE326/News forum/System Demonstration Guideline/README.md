Dear students, You would have to present a software demonstration in the week after the next week. You can choose a major use case and show at least one data entry, query, and display for that use case. It must be done following the proper system architecture and also it should be consistent with the design sketches presented in the class (the faculties might ask to see the relevant design diagrams, so keep them ready). You can do multiple use-cases as well. Choosing a trivial use-case will severely limit your mark. So, please choose wisely. <br /><br />
