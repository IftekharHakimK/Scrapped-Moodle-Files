Dear students,Every group will prepare a Sequence and Collaboration Diagram for the next presentation on all major use-cases like the previous presentations. You will show us the options of the use-cases that you have prepared at the beginning of the presentation. The faculties will select multiple use-cases from them for both the diagrams. You would have to be prepared to show any use-case. You must include all prepared diagrams in your final report to achieve full credit. <br />Drawing State Diagram is optional.
