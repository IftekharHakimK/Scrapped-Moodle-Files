Sir, When using a simple random number generator I am not getting good results. However, I am getting good results when I use a more sophisticated random number generator that I found on GitHub. Can I copy the code for random number generation from GitHub? Or would this be considered plagiarism.<br />

Dear Sir ,  I am confused about the inuse variable in pstat.h . Normally we are are taking processes in getpinfo() whose p->state is not unuse , Does we have to make simply their inuse to 1? or we should consider the process which is currently in scheduling is in use .  It will be helpful for us if you explain it for us in detail .
