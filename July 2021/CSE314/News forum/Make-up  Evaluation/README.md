Dear All, A make-up evaluation class will be held tomorrow at 11 am. Those who have submitted the assignment on Moodle/via email, but were unable to join the evaluation due to sickness or any other reason that you have notified us before,  are requested to join the make-up evaluation class.

Madam, <br />we, student id: 88-90 weren't evaluated due to lack of time( in the xv6 scheduler offline ). Should we join too?
