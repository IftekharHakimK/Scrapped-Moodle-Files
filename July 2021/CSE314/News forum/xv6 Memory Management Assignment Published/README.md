Â 

Dear students,xv6 memory management assignment has now been published. It has been designed in such a way that you would have an in-depth understanding of memory management in a Unix-based Operating system upon successful completion of the assignment. Unconventionally, it is a bit involved and would require a good amount of your time. For this reason, we have published the assignment a day before the class. I would suggest you start early. I can guarantee you won't be able to complete it if you start with only one or two days remaining. If you have any questions, you can ask in the class tomorrow. I would arrange for a consultation class as well at the end of next week in case of further queries. You can also use the news forum (see the xv6 MMA thread).Also, please don't copy solutions from any sources. It would be disheartening for us to give you -100% at the last moment which would ultimately result in a bad grade for you in this course.Best of Luck! <br />
