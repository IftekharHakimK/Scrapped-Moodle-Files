Aside from the reference book in the Operating Systems course, I think the book "<b>*Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces*</b>" by Remzi is a good one to have. This was a more like eye-opener for most of us back in our 3-2 days. I would suggest you collect the pdf of the book (available on the internet. Chapters separately available at the official book site) and study it to get a way better understanding of OS!
