by <a href="https://moodle.cse.buet.ac.bd/user/view.php?id=1767&course=651">Md. Tareq Mahmood</a> - Monday, 10 January 2022, 4:33 PM


 

Dear Students,Next week in your respective lab times, you will present your NS3 project proposal. Each student must prepare a slide/pdf addressing the following points:<ol><li>Modified Algorithm (as directed in the guideline)<br /></li><li>Expected output after the modification (benefits/intuition behind the idea)</li><li>Reference (if the idea is based on an existing source e.g. paper/journal/blog)</li></ol>Please note that
<ul><li>You will get a maximum of <b>2 minutes</b> to present your proposal. So, try to keep it succinct.</li><li>You will also have to submit the slide/pdf by <b>8.00AM on 16 January 2021</b>.</li><li>Your project proposal will be graded.</li></ul>

Many of you have raised an issue regarding where to start gathering a project idea. As mentioned in the guideline, you have to make some modifications at the algorithm level for this project. It can be on any kind of existing protocol on any layer, some are mentioned in the guideline.For example, I have placed some survey papers related to routing algorithms, congestion control algorithms, rate control algorithms in the link <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17OfpS2kklbUTW5ZGDgrojlLI6Vgg8sBz?usp=sharing">here</a>. Some of the algorithms are already implemented in NS3, don't propose those. Also, it is not recommended to propose something whose implementation in NS3 is readily available on the internet.Tips: Navigate around the NS3 codebase to get an idea of the existing algorithms implemented. You can also see the <a href="..%5C..%5Cfile%5Cns-3-model-library.pdf">NS3 model library</a>. Gather an idea about which aspect / algorithm you want to target for modification and comparison, then search papers/surveys regarding that algorithm. You will hopefully find better ideas to implement for this project in this way.More discussions would be done in the next demo class on Saturday. Also, you will be supervised for this project and your initial project idea would be modified as per discussion with your supervisor.
