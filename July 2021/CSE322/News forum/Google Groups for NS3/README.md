Dear Students,We felt the need to open a forum where you can post your NS3 related problems and we (teachers + students) can contribute together.Join the Google group <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/cse-322-july-2021-ns3">https://groups.google.com/g/cse-322-july-2021-ns3</a>We could have initiated a Moodle forum thread, but issues can be quite diverse and a Google group should help us to keep track.<b>You are discouraged to email implementation-related issues to teachers</b>, rather share these issues in Google Groups. We will obviously go through and answer them. Also, chances are others may be having the same issues.*Tip: Set your subscription to "No Email" if you want to avoid receiving an email every time someone posts something in the group.*
