Update on Group Presentation Assignment
by <a href="https://moodle.cse.buet.ac.bd/user/view.php?id=1878&course=651">Syed Md. Mukit Rashid</a> - Wednesday, 26 January 2022, 11:31 AM


 

Dear All,As per your request through your CR's, I have halved the presentations. Now there would be 10 presentations with a group of 3 to 4 members. <br />Presentation time: 6 minutes presentation + 5 min Q/A (Individual viva)Some presentation have been assigned 6 students - they are forming 2 groups of 3 members, also the assigning is given.<br />The group assignment can be found here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lfl_uYAu3o8xiEe8ofw7jxHX-Q4px2zhUXrNZqw6YGU/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lfl_uYAu3o8xiEe8ofw7jxHX-Q4px2zhUXrNZqw6YGU/edit?usp=sharing<br /></a>It is assigned to be in line with your project work for your convenience. (Wireless and Data Collection presentations can be thought of universal as all of you would need to collect data and also simulate wireless topology).<br />Let me know if you have confusions.<br /><br />

If anyone wants to swap groups, let me know here.Also, please let me know by today 10:00 PM. No more changes would be allowed after that.Also please note I would allow swaps, but explicit changes without a swap can only be considered if the presentation topic is absolutely irrelevant to your project. Otherwise, this type of request would not be considered.

You have been assigned to group 8.1705005 is assigned to group 5 (her work is tcp related) as group 7 is scrapped due to other requests.

Sir, My project (ID-1705006)is on AODV routing protocol which is covered in presentation 8.So I would like to give my presentation on that if possible.

Sir, three of us (1705039, 1705052, 1705056) from A2 were assigned presentation topic 7. But it would be more beneficial to us if we were assigned the presentation topic 8. Even though both of them are related to routing protocols the latter (topic 8) covers topics that are more specifically relevant to our projects (e.g. updating packet header, AODV, handle routing) and would aid us in our implementations later on.

Can you merge with the other 3 already assigned to group 8 and prepare a 12 minute presentation, that would cover both presentations 7 and 8?

Sir, covering both topics within this short time would be quite difficult for us (even with more members). The other group would also feel more burdened. That's why it would be better if we were assigned a single topic.

Then unfortunately I would have to keep you guys in presentation 7.The other group will cover AODV anyways, listening to that would be helpful for you as well.

I, (ID-1705018) from A1, want to join group 10 for ns3 presentation since my selected paper is solely focused on AQM, i think it'd be better for me to join group 10.<br />
