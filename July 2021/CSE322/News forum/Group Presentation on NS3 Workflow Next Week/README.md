Dear All,<br />Next week you would be presenting a group presentation, each on different aspects of the workflow of NS3. The Presentation Outline is given in Moodle. The group and presentation assignment is attached. Each group will prepare one presentation slide on their topic and would get 12 minutes to present, followed by a 10 min Q/A session. Each student of the group will be quizzed. Please refer to the outline for the presentation topic and outline. Please also see the notes at the end.The second update on your ns3 project to your supervisor would be taken the following week (week 11). However, those who have changed your project topic last week, they have to contact their supervisor.<br /><br />Mukit.
