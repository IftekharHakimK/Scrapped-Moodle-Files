Dear Students,From this point on, your project updates will only be evaluated by your supervisors. Please contact your assigned supervisors. <b><br /></b><b>Plan for First Update:</b> Draw circuit diagram, preferably on Proteus. No simulation. No code. If a component is not available in Proteus, just draw a shape (e.g. rectangle) instead and connect wires to it. The motivation behind is to make a blue-print of how you are going to connect wires later in your project.<br /><b>Plan for Second Update:</b>At least one working module.
