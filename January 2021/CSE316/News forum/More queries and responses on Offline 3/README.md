Dear students,We have received the following queries --------------The output is
mentioned to be  "[Operand 1] [Operator] [Operand 2]”.Do we need to perform
the operation or do we need to just print in this format ("56+23")?If it is the former,
what is the range of number input for the Operands and is it necessary to
factor in overflow?<br />
Additionally, do we also need to print the sign of operands in the output?-------------Find the responses below.-------------The output is
mentioned to be  "[Operand 1] [Operator] [Operand 2]”.Do we need to perform

to be considered. Overflow checking is not needed, however, would be
appreciated.<br />
