Here is some of the hardware components required for uploading a program to Atmega32.<br /><ol><li>Atmega32</li><li>Atmega Burner or USBASP programmer</li><li>Breadboard (1 ps)</li><li>Jumper Wires (male-to-female/male-to-male depending on your USBASP programmer) (10 ps)</li></ol>You will also need a software named "Extreme Burner" for windows and "Avrdude" for Linux to upload your hex file to Atmega32. I am uploading a slide now, which I will explain in theory class next week. But you are welcome to have a look beforehand.
