<h2>Practice on ATmega32 B2</h2>Suppose you have 4 LEDs connected to Port B. You have to implement a 4 bit counter using these 4 LEDs. You have 3 push-buttons. One is used to increment the counter, one is used to decrement the counter and the remaining one is used to reset the counter. The counter must wrap around. You also have one zero indicating LED connected to Pin 1 of Port A. Whenever the counter reaches zero (through incrementing, decrementing or resetting), turn this LED ON. And turn this OFF when it moves from zero.<br />
