<h2>Practice on ATmega32 A2/B1</h2>Suppose you have 4 LEDs connected to Pin 0, 1, 6, and 7 of Port C. Implement a 4 bit counter using these 4 LEDs. You have 2 push-buttons X & Y. When X is pressed, update the value of the counter. When Y is pressed, toggle the direction of counting (UP/DOWN) and complement the value of the counter. Connect X & Y as an active low switch to Port A. You have another LED connected to Pin 4 of Port C. Keep it ON during UP counting and OFF during DOWN counting.
