<h2>Practice on ATmega32 A1</h2>Suppose, you have 2 LEDs connected to Pin 0, 3 of Port C of ATmega32. You also have three inputs (logic state from Proteus, say x, y, z) and are connected to Pin 0, 2, 4 of Port B, respectively. Initially, the two LEDs are turned off. You also have a push-button connected to ATmega32 as an active low switch, and when the button is pressed, these 2 LEDs will show (in binary) the number of active bits of our three inputs x, y, z.Â
