I am postponing my evaluation of assignment 5 tomorrow and Wednesday due to health reasons. I shall announce a suitable time for the evaluation upon discussion with the class representatives.<br />Tahmid Hasan

Upon discussion with the class representatives, the evaluation sessions will be held on Thursday, July 29. One group will come to my evaluation link at 11, the other at 3. If anyone has problems joining at the above-mentioned time slots, they may mail me and arrange another time for evaluation.
