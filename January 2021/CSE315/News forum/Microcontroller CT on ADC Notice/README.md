Dear Students,I am changing the platform of tomorrow's CT. The CT was supposed to be taken using Google Form. Instead, it will be taken using pen-and-paper. I will upload the question at about 12.05pm. You will write answer on paper, scan the paper and submit that on Moodle.Let me know if you have any question.
