Dear Students, As per the instructions and directives from BUET authorities, classes will continue until further notice. Therefore, classes and assessments will continue on our regular schedule. The students who do not attend classes will be penalized accordingly (i.e., attendance and continuous assessment grades will be affected). There will be no make-up classes and extra (online) office hours for the classes you have missed, nor will the assessment schedule be altered.
