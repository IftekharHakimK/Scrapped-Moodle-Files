My primary device for navigation on PC is keyboard, so it is problematic for me (I am used to it and pretty serious about it). Is it allowed to print out the exam question? <br />Is on-screen keyboard considered "keyboard" in the instruction?What is the experience of the instructors taking the exam with this instructions "Keep your video on and keep yourself in such a position that you can be seen writing"? Is it beta-tested before or this is the first time?<br />

And I can also use keyboard with my fingers of my LEG (a special skill). Since you did not install a 360 camera at my living room, how are you going to detect that?<br />

Can a demo video be provided about how to position the camera? I am trying to figure it out for 4 days. But the camera is not stable due to air movement. This is summer and I cannot switch the fan off. Will I get extra 10 minutes if the camera falls down in the middle of the exam and breaks my attention?<br />

"you can be seen writing" - does it need to cover my face as well so that it can be detected whether I am using my voice over another social media? My camera does not support such wide angle if that is the case.<br />
