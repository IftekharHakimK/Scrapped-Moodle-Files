Dear All,
<br />
Although evaluations of a few students are pending, I can safely give you this message as evaluations of the majority are done.
<br />
This year it was very difficult to perform the sessional activities through the online mediums due to the pandemic situation. Moreover, it is more difficult to work in a group through online media. Nevertheless, we believe that you have put your best effort to learn about computer architecture. Also, you have shown your dedication throughout the semester overcoming the network and other related limitations. That's why you deserve big THANKS from the course instructors. We believe you will successfully apply your knowledge of this course in the future and thus will make the world a better place to live in.
<br />
It was also very tough for the instructors as the problems you have faced are also applicable for them. Despite that, they have given their best. So, personally, I would like to THANK all the instructors.
<br />
Finally, we planned to cover up before the Eid vacation so that you can enjoy the vacation without any tension of CSE 306. And we have successfully done it. 
So, with a relaxed mind, we can say,
Advanced Eid Mubarak to you all.
<br />
[N.B: It is only a thanksgiving post, not to post to get your feedback. If you want to give any constructive feedback, then you can give it to the separate feedback form available in the Moodle.]
<br />
Last but not the least, STAY SAFE, AND TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS.
<br />
Thanking you,
Madhusudan
<br />

It was a really kind gesture sir. Also, being one of the very first courses to have been ending this term, made me feel a bit nostalgic. Hope every instructor associated with this course have a great Eid. Cheers!
