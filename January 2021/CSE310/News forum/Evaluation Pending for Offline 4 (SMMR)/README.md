Those who were to show me your offline 4 for evaluation, but could not be present during the scheduled evaluation dates (Roll 1705116 and 1705121), please be present Tuesday, 27 July 2021 at 2:30 PM (your scheduled lab time). <br />If it is not possible for you to be present at the aforementioned time, please contact me via email. You have to contact me within this week. Failure to contact within this week Wednesday might result in a ZERO in offline 4.<br />Mukit.
