<b>Attention: Student nos. 1705011-1705020</b>Dear students,You have been assigned to me (see <a href="https://moodle.cse.buet.ac.bd/mod/url/view.php?id=8184">here</a>) for the evaluation of Offline 1 on Symbol Table which is scheduled to be held on next Wednesday, March 24, 2021. But I would not be able  to do the evaluation on that day. Hence, I am hereby rescheduling it on <b>Saturday, March 27, 2021 at 2:30 P.M</b>. Since the time is outside your regular class hours, feel free to ask me for another slot if you have any problem. I regret your inconveniences. <em>Note again that this is only for those students of section A1 who have been assigned to me for evaluation of the offline on Symbol Table, , i.e., st. nos. in the range <b>1705011-1705020</b></em><br />Khaled Mahmud Shahriar<br />
