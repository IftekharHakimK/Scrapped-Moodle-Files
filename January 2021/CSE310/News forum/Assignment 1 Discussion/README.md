Sir, in the assignment details we are said to keep a pointer to symbolinfo in the symbolinfo class to handle chaining method.My question is handling chaining is the property of the hash table not the object used in hash table .if i use linked list in the hash table to handle chaining in place of keeping a pointer in the symbleinfo class , is it ok ?<br />according to my implementation idea  i will have a hash table of linked list of type symbol info. So , chaining will be handled in the linked list .

Provided all the required functionalities work as expected and you can give the expected outputs, you can.You have to thoroughly check if everything works as required.
