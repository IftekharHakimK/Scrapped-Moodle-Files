Dear All,For submission of Assignment 3, please follow the following procedure:1.Open a folder named after your 7 digit student ID2.Place the .l(lex) file, .y(yacc) file and needed symbol table header/.c files in the folder. The lex and yacc file should be named after your roll no. 3.Place a "script.sh" file in your folder. Our expectation is if we place an "input.txt" named file in your folder and run the script file, the desired "log.txt" and "error.txt" files will be produced without any compilation errors/unexpected segmentation faults/grammar conflicts.A sample script.sh file is given in Moodle.4.Zip the folder. The zip file should be named after your 7 digit roll no.5.Submit the zip file.Failure to follow this procedure could result in potential mark deduction. So please try to follow the process.  <br />
