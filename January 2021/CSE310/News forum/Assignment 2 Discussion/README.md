Sir, there is a contradiction between assignment specification (CONST_CHAR) and sample output files (CHAR_CONST). Please check the images...

print CONST_CHAR. It is a pretty minor issue.

Sir, the rule of putting spaces or tabs after the last backslash of single line comment treats the next line as a part of the comment. Should we consider this?If we consider the next line as comment then there will be big difference in outputs.

Consider if there is whitespace after the backslash (eg a space or tab), the next line is valid and not commented, as provided in the sample io.Note: This does deviate from the actual C behaviour of ignoring whitespaces after the backslash and considering the next line as comment as well. But we aren't obliged to follow the rules of C rigorously everywhere, so follow the outputs as provided in the sample I/O. <br />
